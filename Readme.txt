The txt files for the tests can be found in the test folder.
The Results of running the tests can be found in TestResults folder.
All functions were tested for basic functionality and run properly.
When running tests spacing is important. You have to follow the same format as my test cases. that is having a space between each parenthesis and variable.
When running defined functions the answer, the functions, and the answer to any equation solved during it will print out.
this is a flaw with the intrepreter but it will ultimately print out the correct answer
Tests 0-3 run basic functions and print out the answer below the equation and what the answer should be
Test4 built a function to test if the correct answer are being found and is ran for different equations; however this doesnt work for 
any equations that are true/ false bc of a flaw in how the function is written.
